# Project Motivation
This project applies unsupervised learning techniques to identify segments of the German population that form the core customer base for a German mail-order company.  

These segments can then be used to target marketing campaigns towards audiences that have the highest expected rate of conversion into new customers.

This project uses data provided by Bertelsmann Arvato Analytics and includes demographic data for the general population of Germany and the existing customers 
of the mail-order company.  As per AZ Direct GmbH's General Terms, these data sets are not included in this repository.


# File Descriptions
The notebook contains the code required to explore, clean, pre-process, transform and cluster the population and customer datasets.  
It also contains the analysis required to identify and understand the segments of the population to target (and avoid) for future marketing campaigns to maximise the success of these campaigns.
